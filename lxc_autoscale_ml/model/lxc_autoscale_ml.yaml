#                      LXC AutoScale ML
#           Automated Container Scaling Configuration
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the LXC 
# AutoScale ML script. It includes settings for logging, 
# model training, spike detection, scaling actions, API 
# interactions, and more.
#
# The script is designed to automatically scale LXC containers 
# based on real-time metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, 
# and other system indicators. The scaling decisions are made 
# using machine learning models, which can detect anomalies 
# and trends in the data.
